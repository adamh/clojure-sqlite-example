# clj-sqlite

This is a slightly more up to date example of how to interact with sqlite using clojure.

I had some problems finding tutorials that weren't driven by the repl, so here's an example that's not.

## Installation

* Clone this repository
* Install [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)

## Usage

* From the repo directory run `lein run`.
* Or use the code in `src/clj_sqlite/core.clj` and paste it into the lein repl.
